## About
I'm a PhD Candidate in Kinesiology and Neuroscience at the University of Alberta.

I create and conduct experiments in real and virtual worlds manipulating embodiment.

I use visual attention measured via eye movements, and body movement measured via infrared motion tracking to create complex measures of eye, hand, and body coordination.
