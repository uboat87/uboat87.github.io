## About
I research embodiment and object interactions in real and virtual worlds.

I use visual attention measured via eye movements, and movement fluidity measured via body movements, to create complex measures of eye, hand, and body coordination.

I have experience using Eye Tracking, Motion Tracking, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Electroencephalography, Electromyography, Galvanic Skin Response, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation, and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation.

I have instructed several undergraduate courses, taught high school Biology and Math for 4 years, and coached elite competitive swimming for over a decade.
