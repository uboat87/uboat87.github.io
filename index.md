# About
Ewen is a PhD Candidate currently researching embodiment and object interactions in real and virtual worlds. Using visual attention measured via eye movements, and movement fluidity measured via body movements, he creates complex measures of eye, hand, and body coordination. He holds previous Bachelor's degrees in Biology and Education, and a Master's degree in Neuroscience and Movement.

Not only is Ewen an expert user of many human experimental tools and techniques (Eye Tracking, Motion Tracking, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Electroencephalography, Electromyography, Galvanic Skin Response, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation, and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation), but he also possesses the statistical knowledge to analyze large complex datasets, as well as the skills to program in several languages (R, Matlab, Unity, C#, C++, Python).

Ewen instructs undergraduate courses, volunteers with local, national and international organizations teaching brain injury prevention strategies, promoting viewpoint diversity, and communicating strategies for better social media practices. Ewen taught high school Biology and Mathematics for several years, and coached elite youth and university competitive swimming for over a decade.
